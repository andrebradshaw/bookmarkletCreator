# bookmarkletCreator
This is now merged with codeBox_v2 
https://github.com/andrebradshaw/codeBoxJS/blob/master/codeBox_v2.js


This is a bookmarklet for creating bookmarklets.
I love mrcoles as much as the next person, but sometimes I find myself not wanting to open and navigate to a new tab.

This tool will prompt you drop in your Javascript, and it creates a div textarea with your translated code.
